# OPC UA .NET SDK Samples
Here you will find sample projects for C# and VB.NET to guide developers of OPC UA Client and Server applications using our OPC UA .NET SDKs. Each sample is provided as it is without any promise regarding its accuracy and correctness especially in productive environments.

## SDKs
All the samples / projects provided in this repository rely on one of our OPC UA SDKs:
 * OPC UA .NET SDK for Clients (Opc.UaFx.Client)
   * [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Opc.UaFx.Client/)
   * [ZIP Archive](http://docs.traeger.de/downloads?do=download_latest&name=opc.uafx.client&type=zip)
   * [Development Guide](https://docs.traeger.de/en/software/sdk/opc-ua/net/client.development.guide)
 * OPC UA .NET SDK for Clients and Servers (Opc.UaFx.Advanced)
   * [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Opc.UaFx.Advanced/)
   * [ZIP Archive](http://docs.traeger.de/downloads?do=download_latest&name=opc.uafx.advanced&type=zip)
   * [Client Development Guide](https://docs.traeger.de/en/software/sdk/opc-ua/net/client.development.guide)
   * [Server Development Guide](https://docs.traeger.de/en/software/sdk/opc-ua/net/server.development.guide)

## Usage
The samples are implemented to use them quite headless with an absolute minimum number of dependencies (per sample / project). We want to encourage you to copy and use them as you want to fulfil your needs accordingly without any restrictions. To do so you may chose one of the following approaches.

### Copy & Paste
You may just browse the samples and copy the code snippets required into your own [spike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development)). As soon as your spike fulfils your needs you may think about to offer a pull request for the project here.

### Clone, Open & Run
As usual you can just clone this repository, open one of the solutions/projects, set the project of your interest as the "Startup Project" (via right-click on the project) and hit F5 (or click the "green arrow" - play-button).
